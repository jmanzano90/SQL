--- In this SQL project, I downloaded a dataset from Kaggle. ---


--- 1. Select all information from the Police Department where the employeeName begins with Chris.

SELECT * from salaries 
WHERE jobtitle like '%Police Department%' and EmployeeName like 'Chris%'

--- 2. Select job titles where the base pay is greater than $150,000 but less than $270,000 and did not accumulate overtime pay. ---

SELECT jobtitle, basepay, overtimepay from salaries
where basepay > 150000 and basepay < 270000 and overtimepay = '0'
group by jobtitle

--- 3.
